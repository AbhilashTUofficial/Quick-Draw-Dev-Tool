# Quick-Draw-Dev-Tool
This tool will be handy for developers to do some repetitive tasks quickly, including quickly searching queries in multiple internet platforms in a single click and saving my quick guides and other information like commands, shortcuts, and code snippets.
As a developer I often search code snippets and other coding-related things on the internet, ChatGPT made this much easier it's not perfect like ChatGPT doesn't have the latest information in that case it is best to use Google Bard. If you need more processed output then ChatGPT will be better. I am an IOS and Android developer so most of the time I had to read the official Android and iOS doc and search on Google and Bard. If I could search everything in one click then that would be useful.
