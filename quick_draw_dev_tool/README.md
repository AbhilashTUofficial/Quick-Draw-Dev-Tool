## Introduction

The **Developer Toolbox** is your ultimate companion in web development, simplifying the process of managing bookmarks, code snippets, and other development resources. In the fast-paced world of web development, keeping all your essential assets organized can be a daunting task. The Developer Toolbox is here to make your life easier.

### Getting Started

- **System Requirements**: The Developer Toolbox is accessible through a modern web browser.
- **Accessing the Developer Toolbox**: Visit [https://example.com/toolbox](https://example.com/toolbox) to access the Developer Toolbox in your web browser.    


## Managing Bookmarks and Snippets

### Adding Bookmarks and Snippets

Easily add new bookmarks and code snippets to the Developer Toolbox. In the "Add New Bookmark" and "Add New Code Snippet" sections, enter the resource's name, URL (for bookmarks), or code snippet along with a brief description, then click "Add Bookmark" or "Add Snippet." Your resources are securely stored in the toolbox.

### Accessing Bookmarks and Snippets

In the "Bookmarks" and "Code Snippets" sections, all your saved bookmarks and code snippets are conveniently organized for quick access. Say goodbye to endless scrolling – everything you need is in one place.

### Editing Bookmarks and Snippets

Need to make changes? No problem! The Developer Toolbox allows you to edit your bookmarks and code snippets. Simply select the resource you want to edit, make your changes, and save. It's that easy.

### Organizing Resources into Collections

To keep your bookmarks and code snippets organized, you can create collections. In the "Collections" section, you can create and manage collections of related resources, making it even easier to find what you need.

### Updatable Bookmark Card Icons

The Developer Toolbox now supports updatable bookmark card icons. You can customize the icons associated with your bookmarks for easier recognition.

### Updatable Bookmark Icons

In addition to bookmark card icons, you can update the icons of individual bookmarks to make them more visually distinctive.

## Streamlined Development

### Use Case

When developing websites, it's common to have a split-screen layout – one side for coding in your editor and the other for previewing in a browser. This setup can make it challenging to manage essential resources, including bookmarks and code snippets.

### How the Developer Toolbox Helps

The Developer Toolbox is tailored to your web development workflow. It's your central repository for bookmarks, code snippets, and development resources. With it, you can efficiently manage and access these assets without disrupting your workflow. Instantly reference code examples, bookmarks, and web development best practices.

## Future Scope and Features

### Multisearch

In the future, the Developer Toolbox will introduce a multisearch feature, allowing you to search across multiple platforms simultaneously. No need to switch between various search engines – find what you need with a single query.

### Keep Files

We're working on a "Keep Files" feature that will enable you to store files, including screenshots, documents, and other resources, for easy access within the Developer Toolbox.

### Custom Icons

Expect custom icons! Soon, you'll have the option to upload custom icons for bookmarks and collections, making your resources visually appealing and easy to identify.
